UC38Up4IKdiHA5J_EAJ_WU1A,BeatBoulevard,"For the past 20 years, as an ESL teacher, the choice of learning materials has been very important. Among other things. I couldn't help but use YouTube videos and was looking for a way to get these to as many people as possible.

Teachers help learners acquire the target language by providing interesting language materials. This channel aims to help learners use it for learning anytime, anywhere by making videos with movie clips that have already been verified in the market.

I do not own the copyright of the clips used in most of the videos.
Sources are movie trailers, teasers, clips, etc. and are intended to be used ""for educational purposes only"".

It makes it easy to learn by simply playing the video. Whether viewed with concentration or used as a sleep video, it was created through specialized cognitive activities and audiovisual effects.

Lastly, thank you to the platform provider YouTube, as well as to the studios and creators who made these wonderful videos.",2017-10-25T19:11:57Z,CA,@beatboulevard3,75542,60,3175,False,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC38Up4IKdiHA5J_EAJ_WU1A

Celebrating 30th Season on the Stage in the Music 

Han-Na Chang’s prestigious and unique international career spans nearly three decades.
She first gained international recognition for her precocious musical gifts at the age of 11, when she won
the First Prize and the Contemporary Music Prize at the Fifth Rostropovich International Cello
Competition in Paris in 1994. Since then, her extraordinary cello career took her to all major orchestras and concert halls.

Having developed an intense interest in and deep passion for the symphonic repertoire during her late teens and early twenties, she made her formal conducting debut in 2007, at the age of 24, and has since then focused her artistic output exclusively to conducting.  Join her on Instagram and Facebook for more!

Советская не только прославляла, вдохновляла и призывала — величественные и в то же время душевные мелодии Хренникова, Пахмутовой, Таривердиева, Колмановского, Петрова и проникновенные стихи Рождественского, Добронравова, Ошанина, Энтина заставляли улыбаться, грустить и влюбляться. 

А голоса! Все певцы, от академического баса до солиста ВИА, имели высшее музыкальное образование. Профессионализм и душа - вот, пожалуй, в чем особенность и ценность советской песни.  

Советское телевидение немыслимо и без классической музыки. Опера и балет были непременными составляющими эфира. Музыкантам и танцоров СССР рукоплескал весь мир.

UC813jGofVJXoyN2fxoQbb-Q,Sonata Secrets,"Classical music has an amazing ability to express a wide range of emotions and activities, but how is that achieved exactly? What are the mechanisms that make it speak to us so strongly and intimately?

My name is Henrik Kilhamn, I'm a classical pianist and I'm very interested in how music works. I try to answer questions like these in my videos by going through pieces from beginning to end – playing, analyzing and presenting my interpretation of them. The score is up on the screen as well as some added graphic elements for further illustration, and sometimes even a partial or full performance follows.

My goal is that these videos will prove interesting and stimulating, and will guide music enthusiasts as well as new listeners to further enjoy and explore the treasure of the world’s classical music.

UCB48w8dWLcD63xz9S8t-YfA,Roy van Vugt,"Hi, I'm Roy van Vugt, a classical singer and pianist based in the Netherlands. I hope to inspire people and brighten their day with my classical music! 

My love for music started early, at the age of 8 I sang my first solo with orchestra as a boy soprano. Later I went to the Royal Conservatoire of the Hague, where I am now also active. I started playing piano in 2019, which I enjoy doing so far. In my career as a boy soprano, I have held solo concerts as well as performed on TV, radio and in operas with orchestras on major stages (i.e. Concertgebouw, TivoliVredenburg). I was involved in various productions such as the Koningsdagconcert, Podium Witteman, Aus Licht & A White House Cantata. After my voice change in the summer of 2021, I am now fully developing as a high baritone. Subscribe to my channel for more classical music and share your thoughts and ideas with me!😄

The repertoire was soon expanded to include works ranging from Monteverdi to Mozart. The LBE choir is a tightly-knit group of around twenty (semi-)professional singers who perform many concerts per year in the Netherlands and abroad. 

Since its foundation, LBE has had a professional Baroque orchestra, built around a core of exceptional instrumentalists and vocal soloists. Its artistic director is Tymen Jan Bronda. 
The LBE aims to involve the audience in the emotional richness and intense drama of Baroque music, for example through theatrical performances. This is consistent with the views from the time of Bach that music can give emotional insight into the essential aspects of life.

Russell who was Minister of Music at First Presbyterian Church of Evanston, IL from 1986-1999. The ""labor of love"" part comes in from a huge project begun 25 years after his retirement to digitize cassette audio tapes, and video tapes so that we can re-live and re-love those precious memories. We hope to share these memories with members of the Chancel Choir who sang these anthems and major works to the Glory of God during those years. Many are already singing and rejoicing in heaven, and we thank God that we were able to share that time on earth with them. For those of us still waiting for that reward, we hope you will join us in Praising our Lord through these musical works.

Now they're using a bunch of older videos (including some they manually removed their own claims on before) as an excuse to delete my channel because I didn't back down when threatened.

A lot of 'em aren't even monetized & none of them are the video that set them off. If the video really violated their rights, they'd be striking that one. Not 33 other videos instead.
