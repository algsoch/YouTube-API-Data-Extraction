Su musica me parece perfecta en composición: Ritmo, Armonia, Melodia, es el conocimiento maximo sobre el arte de la musica y su pureza, belleza, expresividad, delicadeza, arte en su maxima expresión, hace que al escuchar a J.S.Bach me haga sentir cosas increibles, una armonia corporal y mental indescriptible y una paz interna que solo sus composiciones me provocan, tambien me hace viajar por mundos desconocidos y apasionantes, ya que la grandeza de J.S.Bach en gran parte es la manera en que aprendio todo tipo de tecnicas, ritmos, armonias, modulaciones, disonancias, etc
Esto es un homenaje al maestro de  maestros de la musica, el compositor por excelencia.

UC61WdtKe4XEMCSLlTkuEIJg,SecondChairMusic,"Revealing the secret lives of our favorite composers.

Hey there, I’m Monique. I studied bassoon performance as an undergrad and music education as a grad student. 

Out of all the musical subjects that I’ve studied throughout my years of formal training, music history is BY FAR my favorite. I love reading about the evolution of western classical music, as well as the life and times of those who wrote it. A lot of our favorite composers led pretty colorful lives, and reading about them is always loads of fun for me!

I love geeking out about Beethoven and Shostakovich but unfortunately, nobody in my personal life really cares…(I’d tell ONE little interesting tidbit and I’d be met with “uh huh” and glossy eyes (ᗒᗣᗕ)).

So...I’ve turned to YouTube to spread my love of these stories! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!!

P.S. I created this channel back in 2019, but didn't upload my first video until January 2022.

UC7QX724vt3YwVnkMwtmdqNA,Музыка на советском телевидении,"Этот канал мы полностью посвящаем музыке на советском телевидении.

Советская не только прославляла, вдохновляла и призывала — величественные и в то же время душевные мелодии Хренникова, Пахмутовой, Таривердиева, Колмановского, Петрова и проникновенные стихи Рождественского, Добронравова, Ошанина, Энтина заставляли улыбаться, грустить и влюбляться. 

А голоса! Все певцы, от академического баса до солиста ВИА, имели высшее музыкальное образование. Профессионализм и душа - вот, пожалуй, в чем особенность и ценность советской песни.

The LBE aims to involve the audience in the emotional richness and intense drama of Baroque music, for example through theatrical performances.

UCCyjqY4X-7DjfXgnfRJhXIA,The Peery Piano Method,"If you play (or teach) the piano and are looking for ways to explore and improve the *sound* of your playing you have come to the right place!  The Peery Piano Method was developed with sound (and you) in mind.

Peery recognizes that, as Classical musicians working with fixed content, all of our creativity and artistry lies in the sounds we make.  As such, Peery dedicates the same amount of love, time and musical attention to repertoire of all levels - from beginning to advanced.  

The FOUNDATION videos give you access to the tools needed to make the sounds you want.  The IMITATION videos apply these tools and fine-tune your listening through graded repertoire scores with a musical 'roadmap' (Peery Musical Markings) of one sound option.   The CREATION videos invite and inspire you to get to the piano and play!

Preparation ahead of rehearsal, including continuous listening and score familiarization, leaves more time for the director to work on ensemble development, interpretation, and musical nuances.

In these videos, each individual choral part is emphasized with a precise piano sound, while choral 'ahhs' play in the background to voice the other sections.  I am starting with the oratorio 'Elijah' Op. 70 (Felix Mendelssohn), which is part of our repertoire next season.  I will be posting practice tracks for additional choral works in the near future.

All practice videos were created personally by me (the channel creator) using composer software.  All music repertoire appearing on this channel is in the public domain.

✅ Classical masterpieces in every key
✅ Anime & Studio Ghibli music across 12 or 24 keys
✅ Merged versions that blend major and minor modes

""Ci sono domande?"".

Uno studente gli chiese: 
""Professore, qual è il significato della vita?"".

Qualcuno, tra i presenti che si apprestavano a uscire, rise. 
Il professore guardò a lungo lo studente, 
chiedendo con lo sguardo se era una domanda seria. 
Comprese che lo era. ""Le risponderò"" gli disse.

Estrasse il portafoglio dalla tasca dei pantaloni, 
ne tirò fuori uno specchietto rotondo, 
non più grande di una moneta.
 
 Poi disse: ""Ero bambino durante la guerra. 
Un giorno, sulla strada, vidi uno specchio andato in frantumi. 
Ne conservai il frammento più grande. 
Eccolo. 
 
Cominciai a giocarci e mi lasciai incantare dalla possibilità 
di dirigere la luce riflessa negli angoli bui dove il sole non brillava mai: 
buche profonde, crepacci, ripostigli. 
Conservai il piccolo specchio. 
 
Diventando uomo finii per capire che non era soltanto il gioco di un bambino, 
ma la metafora di quello che avrei potuto fare nella vita.

Anch'io sono il frammento di uno specchio che non conosco nella sua interezza. 
Con quello che ho, però, posso mandare la luce, la verità, 
la comprensione, la conoscenza, la bontà, la tenerezza 
nei bui recessi del cuore degli uomini e cambiare qualcosa in qualcuno. 
Forse altre persone vedranno e faranno altrettanto.

In questo per me sta il significato della vita"".",2011-03-15T18:34:47Z,,@mracquaefuoco,23435273,56500,2994,False,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbcpDZ_LUjzg69XpzoxZg

For it was from the free forms with which he became familiar in the course of his piano lessons with the Cortot pupil Mithat Fenmen that he developed an aesthetic outlook that constitutes the core of his self-conception as a composer. Fazıl Say has been touching audiences and critics alike for more than twenty-five years in a way that has become rare in the increasingly materialistic and elaborately organised classical music world. Concerts with this artist are something else. They are more direct, more open, more exciting; in short, they go straight to the heart.

I am a voice teacher who teaches functional singing based on balanced vocal vocal vectors. This is the key to bel canto singing and it is almost extinct today. The technique I teach works for all genres of music as it is based on getting your voice functioning freely. I train the voice just as an athlete trains their body, as the vocal mechanism is a series of muscles. Understanding how these muscles work most efficiently and how to train them will give you the vocal freedom you need to express your art.

Additionally, I have successfully helped singers reverse nodules, vocal cord paralysis, uneven vocal folds, airiness, hoarseness and underdeveloped or poor vocal technique.

Abgerundet wird das Ganze durch einen perfekten Schnitt und letztendlich zu einem repräsentativen Konzertfilm. Dieser kann auf einer gestalteten DVD bzw. Bluray oder im Internet präsentiert werden.

Klassik ist unser Programm. Doch nicht nur. Wir bieten Mitschnitte für  fast jede Gelegenheit: Sei es Theateraufführungen, Modenschauen, Konzerte und Lesungen

He has played virtually every important organ in the world, including those in Bach's Thomaskirche in Leipzig, Berliner Dom, Notre-Dame, Saint-Sulpice and Saint-Eustache in Paris, National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, and Canterbury Cathedral, as well as the world's largest existing instrument, the Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia. His Quadruple Platinum Disc winning album ""From Ravel to Vangelis"" (SONY, 2007), is the best-selling organ CD ever.

Mi recorrido en este increíble mundo comenzó a la edad de 14 años, a través de la musica clásica y sacando canciones de oído. A los 18 continué mi formación en el conservatorio “Astor Piazzolla” de Buenos Aires, mientras tocaba música popular en bandas de rock. Unos años después completé la carrera de música popular en el SADEM, con especialización en folclore Argentino. 

Los años siguientes fui tecladista y corista en giras, y me dediqué a la producción musical, creando arreglos y pistas para artistas. En 2014, lancé mi canal de YouTube, donde enseño a tocar canciones con tutoriales detallados y partituras.

Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra (KSO), numbering 71 musicians from 17 different nations, is one of Norway’s seven full-time professional symphony orchestras.

🌱This channel is a record of my artistic journey, through voice, music, and expression.

If something here resonates with you, I’m truly grateful!!

_______

✨My dream is to live in Europe as an artist, where I can immerse myself in music. If possible, pursue a master’s degree. I want to create beautiful music with inspiring collaborators！


 💫I also dream of:  

-  intimate concerts like a Schubertiade🎻

-  creating a salon inspired by 1920s Paris — a place where art, philosophy, meaningful conversations, and inspiring exchanges come alive🕊️

These are open to all, beyond age, gender, nationality, warm & welcoming places, where people care for one another.

I am gradually taking steps toward these dreams🌿

(As a first step, I’ve started offering online lessons🎵 If you’re interested, feel free to get in touch

UCkzuqFpuOoYi3nhty-SpQzA,the machine in the botanical garden,"I am a composer who combines the rawness of electronic sound with the warmth of acoustic instruments and melodic vocals. Here you will find original songs in which I mix modular synthesizers, sequencers, and other electronic devices with string quartets, guitars, orchestral instruments, and singers.
In my music, the word is just as important as the melody. I love to give a new dimension to classical poems from some of the best poets in history, such as Emily Dickinson, Emily Brontë, among others. Through the unique combination of electronic and acoustic sounds, I aim to pay homage to the beauty and depth of these writings, offering a distinct and inspiring musical experience.

UCn_LofbjJ6BuUURmR56R1Ug,Sameer Murthy,"Dear Visitor / Subscriber,
Thanks for seeing or subscribing to this channel. I am Sameer Murthy, a music enthusiast. 
I have been listening to Indian classical music predominantly from childhood. Due to passion, I have a collection of Indian Classical & Western music on Vinyl records & Tapes that I share on this channel after some audio restoration work (only if necessary) for listening pleasure amongst people keen towards this genre of music. Audio restoration is primarily done on Vinyl records that are more than 35 to 50 years old. There are recordings from the 1960's which certainly require some audio restoration work for a pleasurable listening experience. 

This channel mainly portrays Indian Classical music (Hindustani or Carnatic), I will also post a few Western classical recordings sometimes & also programs that I would stream live going forward.

If you find the content interesting, please do subscribe to my channel for regular updates.

Thanks & have a wonderful day.

Um es möglichst vielen Menschen - egal, in welcher Lebenssituation sie sich befinden - zu ermöglichen an dieser Anrufung Gottes teilhaben zu können, ist die BARRIEREFREIHEIT in unserer Kathedrale zu einem Grundsatz geworden, den wir schon mehrfach umsetzen konnten: Von der stufenlosen Zutrittsmöglichkeit, über Induktionsschleifen für Hörgeschädigte und der regelmäßigen Übersetzung der Gottesdienste in die Gebärdensprache bis zu Liveübertragungen via Internet und Fernsehen.

Wir laden Sie sehr herzlich zur Mitfeier am Lobe Gottes über unser Livestream-Angebot ein!

Regelmäßige Gottesdienst-Livestreams:
Montag-Freitag: 06:30, 07:00 und 07:20
Sonn- und Feiertage: 08:30 und 10:00 (1x monatlich mit Gebärdenübersetzung)

UCoAthg_-EW4eK--yszy-qbg,Chad Lawson - Topic,"World-renowned pianist Chad Lawson has profoundly reshaped the role that music plays in our daily lives. On his luminous new album breathe, the Steinway artist expands on the intentionality he brought to his 2020 effort You Finally Knew, transforming his decidedly modern take on classical music into a conduit for stillness, serenity, and self-reflection. Recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios (the same facility where he recorded YFK, whose standout track “Stay” has held steady in the top 25 on the Billboard Classical chart for over 100 weeks), breathe ultimately establishes Lawson as an essential voice exploring the intersection of music and wellness.

Lawson began classical training in piano as a child and later developed a thriving career as a jazz pianist, but eventually felt compelled to follow a new direction in his music. As his audience grew exponentially, Lawson soon found himself featured on the likes of CBS Sunday Morning and NPR’s All Things Considered, in addition to turning out a series of #1 releases and landing high-profile sync placements with such shows as The Walking Dead and Viceland. Recently, Lawson has widened his reach with the launch of his Calm It Down podcast. A fully independent one-man show, Calm It Down finds Lawson expounding on an inspired range of topics (forgiveness and anxiety, butterflies and Snoopy), setting his insightful yet charmingly candid ruminations against a tranquil backdrop of his own solo piano music.",2014-01-16T14:47:25Z,,,43310841,1080,711,False,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoAthg_-EW4eK--yszy-qbg

UCqZRQWHOHZKxgFVjObY4lVg,Blooming Classic,"🌿 채널 소개 – Blooming Classic (구 생각꽃)

좋은 음악이 머무는 곳에 좋은 생각이 피어납니다.
Blooming Classic은 바로 그 생각의 꽃이 음악 속에서 피어나는 공간입니다.

이 채널은 처음에 **“생각꽃”**이라는 이름으로 시작했습니다.
시대를 초월해 사랑받아온 바흐, 헨델, 비발디에서부터
하이든, 모차르트, 베토벤, 그리고
슈베르트, 쇼팽, 브람스, 드뷔시, 라벨까지—
클래식 음악이 가진 깊이와 따뜻함을 감성적으로 큐레이션해 왔습니다.

고요한 독서 시간, 산책길의 발걸음, 커피 한 잔의 여유,
마음의 안정이 필요한 순간 등 삶의 다양한 장면에 어울리는 음악을 선곡합니다.
때로는 명화와 함께, 때로는 계절의 감성에 따라 음악이 이야기를 만들어 갑니다.

🌸 Blooming Classic(구 생각꽃)은
좋은 음악에 대한 생각이 마음속에 자라 꽃을 피울 때,
그 순간을 함께 나누기 위해
퍼블릭 도메인 및 크리에이티브 커먼즈 음원을 확보하고,
세심하게 배경 화면과 영상을 제작합니다.

이제 이름은 Blooming Classic으로 새롭게 피어났지만,
처음의 마음—**“생각꽃”**이 품었던 음악에 대한 사랑과 정성—은 그대로입니다.

지금, 클래식으로 피어나는 생각의 꽃을 만나보세요. 🌿🎶

🎓 본 채널은 YouTube Player for Education(교육용 플레이어)에 참여하고 있습니다. 이 채널의 콘텐츠는 음악사 및 클래식 감상 교육을 위한 자료로, 교사·학생 등이 학습용 환경에서 광고 없이 시청할 수 있습니다.

UCrHICovzXa3ePnfRqUV5wkQ,Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment,"Ok, it’s a not very snappy name, so we tend to call ourselves the OAE.

We try to be authentic, by using instruments and playing styles similar to those the composer would have been familiar with.

You might be wondering what difference this makes to the actual sound. Well, it tends to be a more edgy sound than polished modern orchestras. It’s a gutsy and definitely a less ‘polite’ sound. Plus the OAE is well known for its sheer enthusiasm for music, which comes across at every performance.

“Humans experience emotional pressure from all the repressed emotions pushed down for generations. The unconscious continues to repress these emotions as a protection mechanism from emotional pain. The most important thing for humans right now is to start reconnecting to the emotional body and learn to experience emotions in a fluid way.

Self-observation, from a place of nonjudgment and allowance, of behavior patterns, thoughts and emotions that arise on a daily-basis. Seeing and owning your destructive behavior patterns is the first step toward freeing yourself from the obstacles that sabotage your happiness and peace of mind. You begin to see where your compulsion to judge others originates: You see traits in others that you fear in yourself. After observation, it becomes easier to make new choices in life. Self-observation also leads to self-forgiveness, an essential part of the equation.” The Golden Lake - Lyssa Royal-Holt

UCtGRtj4gf2BsQXi4k4OmaRA,Bethany College,"Founded in 1881 by Swedish-Lutheran immigrants, Bethany College helps students discover their own gifts, talents, skills, abilities, and passions. Students find their pathways to purpose by participating in an active campus life (with more than 50 organizations and athletic programs). Bethany's academic programs are powered by attentive faculty who challenge students with meaningful curriculum. Engaging experiences in and out of class develop communication and critical thinking skills, which prepare students for successful careers and lives of faith, learning, and service. Bethany's core values of integrity, hospitality, community, and servant leadership involve students in something bigger than themselves. Bethany's fine arts continue rich histories, including the tenure of painter Birger Sandzén and the longest-running American Messiah performance. As a college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Bethany encourages students to explore and deepen their faiths.

An Internet sensation at a young age, his videos amassed over 150+ million views before he turned 19. He won two major talent shows in Europe (Poland, Italy) and reached mainstream audiences through his performances in America's Got Talent. 

His creations borderline the impossible - arranging full symphony orchestral pieces onto one guitar, combining hip-hop production with instrumental guitar music, and jumping between classical, flamenco and hyper modern influences. Among Marcin's most popular creations are his arrangements of Beethoven's 5th Symphony, Kashmir, Moonlight Sonata, Still D.R.E. and many originals.

In January 2020 Marcin got signed by Sony Music making him one of the first percussive guitarists to sign with a major label. ",2020-04-20T22:10:31.198717Z,,@marcinvevo,53455972,3580,19,False,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpyAZcyO876qHDpf2X-U_Q

Different styles of classical music can enhance alertness and concentration, foster optimism and a positive outlook on life, and also quiet the mind and relax muscles, leading to a feeling of soothing tranquility and stress relief. Music is an effective tool for relaxation and stress management. Research supports these personal experiences with music, indicating that listening to music can alter brain function to a similar extent as medication. What's the right music for you? First and foremost, you must enjoy the music being played, and then it should help you relax. We encourage you to begin your musical journey by simply exploring the music on this channel. Press play, close your eyes, and enjoy the music!

UCz7xX0oKimz9WL5ey5CiRIA,OrzoMondo,"I create electronic arrangements of classical pieces for my own entertainment. In this (2021) lockdown, stay-at-home year, I picked up this old passion of mine. Back in the early 90s I had a Yamaha QY10, on which, laboriously, I transcribed Bach's Brandenburg Concertos.

What I found out in the last few weeks is that there are many tools and resources online, some of them free, others rather cheap, and you only need a laptop and an audio interface to do much more with a lot less effort. Maybe in the future I will share some of my experience in getting up to speed for others who share the same passion.

UCxVXgcVjhGLBmLA76WSJnPA,American Classical Orchestra,"The American Classical Orchestra is devoted to preserving and performing the repertoire of Baroque and Classical composers.  By playing the music on original instruments and using historic performance techniques, we attempt to recreate the sounds an audience would have experienced when the music was written and first performed.  We pass along skills and appreciation for this practice to future generations through concert performances and educational programs.

Thomas Crawford, Founder & Artistic Director of the American Classical Orchestra, is a champion of historically accurate performance styles in Baroque, Classical, and Early Romantic music. A passionate activist determined to bring the beauty of period music to a wider audience, Crawford renamed his first period instrument orchestra-- Old Fairfield Academy-- to  the ""American Classical Orchestra"" in 1999, and moved the Orchestra’s performance and operational home to Manhattan in 2005.

UCyo5FdzTWxpb1tSXUD3jDxw,Musikprojekte,"Hi, don't let anyone discourage you from learning piano or organ, no matter your age. I only started reading notes and playing piano with 53y, followed by playing the organ with 60y. My experience:
Try to practice regularly at your own pace, use tutorials from youtube and if possibe for you, take some personal teacher lessons. Most important „have fun“ 😊.

This channel shows music projects for enjoyment, to support my daily practice and to get to know musical styles and composers from different eras.

Lasst Euch bloß nicht einreden, Klavier- und Orgelspielen lernen ist im fortgeschrittenen Alter nicht möglich. Mein Name ist Johann Gwehenberger. Ich mache Musikprojekte seit dem Ruhestand . Und das, obwohl ich erst im Jahr 2013 mit dem Noten lesen und Klavierspielen begonnen habe. Im Jahr 2020 kam das Orgelspielen hinzu.

Dieser Kanal zeigt Musikprojekte zur Freude, Unterstützung der täglichen Übung sowie zum Kennenlernen von Musikrichtungen und Komponisten verschiedener Epochen.

UCxf-AbCh1l6RZjMdV-iEp-g,AntPDC,"GentIe Viewer, 

I enjoy all music from Bach to the Beatles. I usually use my own photography for my slideshow music videos. Sometimes I include videos, paintings and other art, not by me, but I share them with much enthusiasm. 

My Channel isn't monetised, but I do not object to adverts because I use copyrighted music and recordings (which I have nevertheless purchased in various formats where possible). Short of no Channel content at all, advertising seems to be a fair, if imperfect, quid pro quo - a means of giving back, to composers, musicians and companies.

I respect copyright owners' property, and stand ready to remove content on request. No need to punish me with a Copyright Strike.

I hope you enjoy your visit, find pleasure here, and make new discoveries. The real stars here are the composers, musicians and other featured artists. 

My best wishes,
