# Project Proposal: YouTube Classical Music Data Extraction

**To**: [Client Name]  
**From**: algsoch  
**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Subject**: YouTube Data API Extraction - 34,000 Classical Music Videos

---

## Executive Summary

I am writing to express my strong interest in your YouTube classical music data extraction project. I have already built a **production-ready application** specifically designed for this type of task and have prepared a working demo with real extracted data for your review.

---

## Live Demo Available

To demonstrate my capability, I have **already extracted 4,668 videos** from similar classical music searches as a proof of concept:

ðŸ”— **Live Demo**: https://youtube-extractor-w9ft.onrender.com/

### What You Can See in the Demo:

1. **Data Tables Page**: View all extracted video and channel data in an interactive table format
2. **Files Page**: Download the extracted data as CSV files at your convenience
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: See data visualization and statistics (currently in development)
4. **Working Extraction System**: The core functionality you need is fully operational

**Note**: The demo is currently focused on the data extraction and export features (which are what you need). The analytics features are still being enhanced but won't affect the deliverables for your project.

## Understanding Your Requirements

Based on your project description, you need:

### Data Collection:
- âœ… **17 search phrases** (Beethoven Symphony, Handel Messiah, Mozart Requiem, etc.)
- âœ… **2,000 videos per phrase** = 34,000 total videos
- âœ… **Video fields**: videoId, title, description, publishedAt, channelTitle, channelId
- âœ… **Channel profile data** for every unique channel discovered
- âœ… **Channel fields**: title, description, publishedAt, country, customUrl, viewCount, subscriberCount, videoCount, hiddenSubscriberCount, channelUrl

### Deliverables:
- âœ… **CSV file with video records** (one row per video, organized by search phrase)
- âœ… **CSV file with channel details** (one row per unique channel)
- âœ… **Timeline**: Completed within 10 days
- âœ… **Communication**: Update you when finished

---

## My Solution & Approach

### Technical Implementation:

I have built a **professional-grade YouTube Data Extractor** using:

- **YouTube Data API v3** (official API, not scraping)
- **Python with FastAPI** for robust backend processing
- **Intelligent quota management** to stay within daily limits (10,000 units/day)
- **Automated CSV export** with all required fields
- **Error handling and retry logic** for reliability
- **Data validation** to ensure completeness and accuracy

### Quota Management Strategy:

The YouTube API has a daily quota of 10,000 units. Here's how I'll manage it:

- **Video search**: 100 units per query
- **Video details**: 1 unit per video
- **Channel details**: 1 unit per channel

**Daily capacity**: ~2,000-2,500 videos per day (safely within quota limits)

**Project timeline**: 
- **Days 1-7**: Extract all 34,000 videos (2,000 Ã— 17 phrases) using multiple API keys if needed
- **Days 8-9**: Extract all unique channel profiles
- **Day 10**: Final verification, CSV formatting, and delivery

### Data Quality Assurance:

âœ… **Complete field capture** - All 6 video fields + 9 channel fields  
âœ… **Duplicate removal** - Unique channels only  
âœ… **Data validation** - No missing critical fields  
âœ… **CSV formatting** - Clean, ready-to-use format  
âœ… **UTF-8 encoding** - Handles international characters properly

## Deliverables

You will receive:

### 1. Video Data CSV (`classical_music_videos_YYYYMMDD.csv`)

Columns:
- `search_query` (e.g., "Beethoven Symphony")
- `videoId`
- `title`
- `description`
- `publishedAt`
- `channelTitle`
- `channelId`

**Expected rows**: ~34,000 (2,000 per phrase)

### 2. Channel Data CSV (`classical_music_channels_YYYYMMDD.csv`)

Columns:
- `channelId`
- `title`
- `description`
- `publishedAt`
- `country`
- `customUrl`
- `viewCount`
- `subscriberCount`
- `videoCount`
- `hiddenSubscriberCount`
- `channelUrl`

**Expected rows**: ~300-500 unique channels (estimated based on demo data)

### 3. Extraction Report

A brief summary document containing:
- Total videos extracted per search phrase
- Total unique channels discovered
- Any videos/channels that couldn't be retrieved (if any)
- Extraction dates and API quota usage
