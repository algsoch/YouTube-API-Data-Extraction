## YouTube Classical Music Data Extraction - Ready to Deliver

Hi [Client Name],

I'm excited about your YouTube classical music data extraction project. **I've already built a production-ready application for this exact purpose** and have a live demo with real extracted data for you to review.

### Live Demo with 4,668 Videos Already Extracted

ðŸ”— **Check it out here**: https://youtube-extractor-w9ft.onrender.com/

**What you can see**:
- **Data Tables page**: All extracted video and channel data in interactive tables
- **Files page**: Download CSV files with the exact format you'll receive
- **Working extraction system**: The core functionality is fully operational

*(Note: The demo focuses on data extraction and CSV export - exactly what you need. Analytics features are still being polished but won't affect your deliverables.)*
