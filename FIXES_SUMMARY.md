## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ → ✅ Quota Exceeded NOT Showing to Users

**Problem:**
- Quota exceeded logged in terminal only
- Users saw "0 channels collected" with no explanation
- Confusing and unprofessional

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added prominent **yellow alert banner** on Dashboard
- ✅ Added prominent **yellow alert banner** on Extraction page
- ✅ Shows countdown timer: "9h 28m until reset"
- ✅ Shows exact reset time: "Midnight Pacific Time"
- ✅ User can dismiss the alert

**Files Changed:**
- `api.py`: Added `quota_exceeded: false` to global state (Line 62)
- `templates/index.html`: Added 2 alert banners (Lines 69-85, 201-217)
- `static/app.js`: Show/hide alert logic (Lines 137-169)

### 2. ❌ → ✅ Analytics Features Broken (NaN Errors)

**Problem:**
```
ValueError: Out of range float values are not JSON compliant: nan
```
- All 6 analytics tabs showing errors
- Charts not rendering
- Tables empty

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `.fillna('')` to replace NaN in string columns
- ✅ Added `.replace({np.nan: '', np.inf: 0, -np.inf: 0})` before JSON
- ✅ Added `int()` type conversions for counts
- ✅ Added NaN filtering in loops

**Files Changed:**
- `data_analyzer.py`: 
  - `get_channel_rankings()` - Fixed all 6 ranking types (Lines 246-305)
  - `get_video_statistics()` - Fixed date ranges and counts (Lines 307-348)

## 📝 For Your Client Demo

### Key Points to Highlight:

1. **Professional Error Handling**
   > "Notice how the system immediately alerts users when the quota is exceeded, 
   > with a clear countdown timer showing exactly when they can resume. This is 
   > much better than silent failures."

2. **Robust Data Processing**
   > "The analytics engine handles incomplete data gracefully - even with NaN 
   > values in the CSV, everything still works perfectly. That's production quality."

3. **User-Friendly Design**
   > "Everything is visual - users don't need to check terminal logs or guess 
   > what's happening. The interface communicates clearly at all times."
